# Raydium Token Freezer (Honeypot Boilerplate)

This bot is a customizable version of a token freezer, originally designed for use with Raydium pools. The original version can be purchased by contacting me, and additional updates, like Jito mode and other features, can be added upon request.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Scan Wallets**: Monitors wallets that buy tokens in Raydium pools.
- **Freeze Token Accounts**: Freezes token accounts by sending transactions to Associated Token Accounts (ATA).
- **Unfreeze Token Accounts**: Option to unfreeze token accounts as needed.

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration

To get started, you'll need to configure certain variables in the `config` folder. Important variables include the main keypair, token mint address, and other settings in the `index.ts` file.

### ðŸš€ Setup & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Immutal0/Raydium-Token-Freezer

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

### 3. Configure the Environment Variables

Open the `index.ts` file and set the following variables:
